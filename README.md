I‚Äôm **Hamas Saeed**, an Embedded Firmware Engineer who loves breathing life into microcontrollers and making machines do my bidding! From designing IoT infrastructure to writing code that optimizes hardware performance, this space is where all the nerdy magic happens. Here's what keeps me going:

- üß† **Embedded Systems Wizard**: Crafting optimized, scalable firmware solutions is my jam!
- üõ† **Hardware Whisperer**: STM32, ESP32, or anything that speaks SPI, I2C, or UART ‚Äì I‚Äôm your guy.
- üß© **Hacker at Heart**: When not coding, I‚Äôm reverse-engineering tech for fun.
- üéÆ **Sci-Fi Enthusiast**: Addicted to the thrill of solving cryptography puzzles or binging on sci-fi series.
